### Data Converter

This Java code defines a class named DataConverter with a main method and a private helper method convertData. The purpose of this program is to read data from one text file (data_file_1.txt), perform a simple conversion on the data, and then write the result to another text file (data_file_2.txt). The data in the input file is expected to be in a specific format, and any lines not adhering to this format are considered invalid.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import Statements:
```
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
```
These statements import classes from the java.io package, which are necessary for reading from and writing to files.

Class Declaration:
```
public class DataConverter {
```
The class is declared as public and named `DataConverter`.

`main` Method:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
```
The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It initializes input and output file names, calls the `convertData` method, and handles any `IOException` that might occur during the conversion process.

File Names:
```
String inputFile = "data_file_1.txt";
String outputFile = "data_file_2.txt";
```
These variables store the names of the input and output files.

`try-catch` Block in main Method:
```
try {
    convertData(inputFile, outputFile);
    System.out.println("Conversion successful!");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("Error converting data: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
The `convertData` method is called within a try block. If an `IOException` occurs during the conversion, an error message is printed.

`convertData` Method:
```
private static void convertData(String inputFile, String outputFile) throws IOException {
```
This private method performs the actual data conversion. It takes input and output file names as parameters and is declared to throw an `IOException`.

`try-with-resources` Block in `convertData` Method:
```
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inputFile));
     PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFile))) {
```
The method uses try-with-resources to automatically close the BufferedReader and PrintWriter instances after the conversion is complete.

Data Conversion:
```
String line;
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
    String[] parts = line.split(",\\s*");
    if (parts.length == 3) {
        // Assuming the first and third columns need to be concatenated
        String convertedLine = parts[0] + " " + parts[2];
        writer.println(convertedLine);
    } else {
        System.err.println("Invalid input format: " + line);
    }
}
```
The method reads each line from the input file, splits it into parts based on a comma followed by optional whitespace, and checks if there are exactly three parts. If so, it concatenates the first and third parts with a space in between and writes the result to the output file. If the input format is invalid, an error message is printed to the standard error stream.
